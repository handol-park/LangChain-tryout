#+title: Personal Assistant using LangChain

* Concept

Personal assistants are a perfect application to build because they combine both of the core value props of LangChain (action taking and personalized data). In order to build a personal assistant you should understand the following concepts.

1. PromptTemplate
   Give your personal assistant some character.
2. Memory
   Hold a conversation (short term memory) or some concept of long term memory.
3. Tools
   What should it know how to do?
4. Agent
   What actions it should take?
5. Agent Executor
   Set up an environment for the agent to use those tools.
